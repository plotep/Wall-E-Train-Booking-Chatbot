# Wall-E-Train-Booking-Chatbot
A train booking chatbot built in python.
## Overview
A chatbot built using the experta library for the knowledge engine, and BeautifulSoup to scrape the information from www.nationalrail.co.uk about the tickets.
The chatbot is able to understand the whole query: Can I get a ticket to Manchaster from London Bridge at 12:00 on the 24th of jan and return on the 27th of jan at 11:00.
If there are missing pieces of information that are not input in the original query, the chatbot will then ask individual questions to fill in the needed information.
Once the information is complete, the bot will then return the information that has been requested. Further functionality implemented is delay detection, where the user
can input current and destination station to find the expected delay of the train that they are on.
